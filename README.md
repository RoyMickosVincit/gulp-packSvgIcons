# gulp-packSvgIcons
A gulp utility that takes a set of small svg icon files and packs them inside one svg document that can be embedded.

The idea is based on an article by Chris Coyier on [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/cascading-svg-fill-color/). A set of small svg icons are bundled into a svg fragment that
can be then injected to a html document using gulp-inject.
